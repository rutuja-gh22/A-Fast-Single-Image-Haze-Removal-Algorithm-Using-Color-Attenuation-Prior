# A-Fast-Single-Image-Haze-Removal-Algorithm-Using-Color-Attenuation-Prior

Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on clear visual input from onboard cameras and sensors to make accurate decisions. However, adverse weather conditions such as haze, fog, and smog degrade image quality, leading to reduced perception accuracy and increased risk.

This project focuses on enhancing the visual perception of autonomous vehicles by implementing and improving **haze removal algorithms**. By restoring scene visibility in degraded images, we aim to improve object detection, depth estimation, and overall reliability of autonomous navigation systems.
